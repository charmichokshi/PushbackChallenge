# PushbackChallenge

As part of the COMP-767: Machine Learning Applied to Climate Change course project by McGill University and Mila we are participating in the [Pushback to the Future: Predict Pushback Time at US Airports](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/149/competition-nasa-airport-pushback/) competition.

This public competition was hosted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The competition aimed to predict the minutes until pushback of a flight using public air traffic and weather data. 

We explored several heuristic-based and ML methods for this task, discovering that machine-learning-based methods marginally outperformed heuristic-based methods. Our submission to the competition based on XGBoost ranked 23rd out of 408 participants.
